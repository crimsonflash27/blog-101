            "content": "Before getting into the actual project, I would like to thank Jahnavi Hunsigida for being a wonderful research partner on the project; and Dr.Sumohana Channappayya of IIT Hyderabad, for giving me an opportunity to work on this project under his mentorship. . The beauty of data science lies in the fact that it can be utilised to solve problems in a wide variety of fields. And, if you do have some domain-specific knowledge , you can find that it opens up a wide variety of options that can be taken to solve the problem at hand. . My problem lies in the field of biology, and involves dealing with protein sequences. It is a well-known fact that we have multitudes of protein sequence data available. The basics of biology will tell you that the activity of any protein is dependent not just on its amino acid sequence, but also factors like the way its backbone is designed; the way it folds in 3-D space; the way proteins units bind together, etc. So, the challenge lies in being able to manipulate only the sequence data – primary structure , in biological jargon - of proteins in order to build models to solve problems in the field. . The work that follows is a continuation of an already published work titled , “A machine learning approach for reliable prediction of amino acid interactions and its application in the directed evolution of enantioselective enzymes”, which deals with using only the sequence data to predict a biological parameter called the enantioselectivity value. . Literature Summary: . The paper discusses a methodology for predicting a property – in this case, the enantioselectivity - of the input protein based on just using its primary sequence. This methodology involves using a Digital Signal Processing Technique called innov’SAR , which is a protein structure independent method. First , the protein sequences are converted into spectrums via amino acid index encoding and Fourier Transform These spectrums, are supposed to capture epistatic interactions between the different mutants. The converted inputs are used to design a ML model , which will in turn predict e-values for each of the inputs. The overall goal is to reduce the time spent in order to study the activity of newly designed proteins. . The authors have already explored and established certain models and parameters for the task at hand. My objective is to try some alternative machine learning models and data manipulations on the same problem and obtain some insights of my own. . The primary steps involved are as follows: . Converting the alphabetical amino-acid sequences into a sequence consisting of their respective amino acid indexes. | Using Fourier Transform to obtain information embedded in the converted sequences. This will serve as one of the inputs, with the other being the non-Fourier transformed sequence. | Using these as input in different Machine Learning models , hoping to capture a relationship between the inputs and the value we are trying to predict- The E-value. | Epistasis: . Before we go into the specifics , I want to talk about an interesting concept in science called “Epistasis”. Epistasis occurs when the mutation at a certain point in the gene is affected by a mutation at another site. As you will all see, the dataset we are dealing with consists of different mutants ( single and multi-point ) of epoxide hydrolase from Aspergillus Niger (ANEH). Hence , the model we design must be able to account for the epistatic interactions that may occur when we have multiple mutant samples. This is especially important when we want to predict the enantioselectivity unknown mutants, which may have multiple mutations at different sites. . Data Modelling: . A very vital step of any Machine Learning project involves converting the raw inputs into a form suitable for interpretation by a ML algorithm. This step is especially crucial, as the representation of the input will majorly impact the performance of the model. . Amino Acid Indexes: . The first step involves converting the alphabetical sequences of the inputs into a numerical form which is suitable for use in a machine learning model. For this purpose, we are going to use amino acid indexes. Amino Acid indexes are numerical quantities we assign to each amino acid based on the physical or chemical characteristic we are dealing with ( AAindex: Amino Acid index database ). In this project, I will be trying a variety of AA indexes and comparing their performance in each modelling scenario. . Machine Learning Models: . It should be obvious that the task at hand requires us to predict a continuous value , making this a regression problem. Keeping this is mind , we will focus on the performance of 2 ML regression models: . Linear Regression – Closed Form . | Support Vector Regression . | Dataset: . Set 1: 1 Wild-Type + 9 single point mutants of ANEH . Set 2: 28 Multi-point mutants of ANEH . The E-values for the mutants were measured in the lab. . This dataset was obtained from the supplementary section of the paper. . Basic Linear Regression . We are going to start things off by using basic linear regression to model the problem. The amino acid index we are choosing is called EIIP. . import pandas as pd import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt . dict_eiip = {&#39;A&#39;: 0.0373, &#39;R&#39;: 0.0959, &#39;N&#39;: 0.0036, &#39;D&#39;: 0.1263, &#39;C&#39;: 0.0829, &#39;Q&#39;: 0.0761, &#39;E&#39;: 0.0058, &#39;G&#39;: 0.005, &#39;H&#39;: 0.0242, &#39;I&#39;: 0, &#39;L&#39;: 0, &#39;K&#39;: 0.0371, &#39;M&#39;: 0.0823, &#39;F&#39;: 0.0946, &#39;P&#39;: 0.0198, &#39;S&#39;: 0.0829, &#39;T&#39;: 0.0941, &#39;W&#39;: 0.0548, &#39;Y&#39;: 0.0516, &#39;V&#39;: 0.0057} . def num_convert(x): return [dict_eiip[i] for i in x] . data = pd.read_csv(&quot;ee_train.csv&quot;) . data.head() .

From just looking at the R2 score, we can probably say that the model does relatively well for the limited number of datapoints we are dealing with. However , the problem we are dealing with is not quite as simple as getting the line of closest fit due to the problem of epistasis. . To calculate epistasis , we need to see if the e-value obtained due to multiple mutations is lower or higher than the theoretical additive value obtained by adding each individual mutation. Higher leads to positive epistasis; lower leads to negative epistasis. Hence, even if the predicted e-value is close to the actual value , there is the aspect of predicting the correct epistatic state. . Now, when it comes to the linear regression model , the predicted values for the multi-mutant test set is an exact match with the theoretical additive e-values. This observation stays the same regardless of the nature of the amino-acid index we use (This will be proved in later sections of the post, where we try other AA indexes). . Now, to verify if the linear regression model is insensitive to the exact values of the indexes, lets try a one-hot encoding model. .

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) . The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it. . . Interactive Charts With Altair . Charts made with Altair remain interactive. Example charts taken from this repo, specifically this notebook. .

This guide provides more detail about this syntax, which looks like this: . For example, here is a footnote {% fn 1 %}. And another {% fn 2 %} {{ &#39;This is the footnote.&#39; | fndetail: 1 }} {{ &#39;This is the other footnote. You can even have a [link](www.github.com)!&#39; | fndetail: 2 }} .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 .
