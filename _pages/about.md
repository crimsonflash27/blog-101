<h3>Project in Data Science and AI:</h3>

	<h4>Project Title: Video Quality Assessment using Vision Transformers</h4>

<p>
	Project was a part of the Artificial Intelligence and Emerging Technologies course conducted at IIT Hyderabad.  
	We utilized a pre-trained vision transformer model - trained on Image Net 1K dataset – to extract features from videos to predict video quality.  
	The extracted features were passed through trained Support Vector Regression model for predicting Mos (Mean Opinion Score) score, which is used as a metric for assessing video quality.
